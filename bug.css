The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.  For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` within a `width` property might work as expected, but using something like `calc(100% - 10%)` within a `margin` or `padding` property can lead to strange results because percentages are relative to the parent element's content area (not including padding/margins) but percentage width is relative to the containing block width.   Another common error involves incorrect unit usage or missing operators resulting in a syntax error.
